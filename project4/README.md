# Project 4: Robotic Planning Algorithm with Reachability-Guided RRT (RG-RRT)

Name: Chung-Yu (Vincent) Chang 張仲瑜, Chen-En (Sean) Lin 林辰恩 

## Introduction

- In this project, we aim to solve path planning problems for a pendulum and a car (square robot) with dynamical constraints using RRT, KPIECE, and RG-RRT route planning algorithm. 
- We implement RG-RRT from scratch and use OMPL's built-in algorithms to solve the motion planning problems.

- In the first part of the experiment, we compare the solution path given under different torque constraints for pendulums. 

- In the second part, we focus on comparing the solution path generated by RG-RRT with RRT and KPIECE with the OMPL benchmarking package.

- See [Project4_cl307_vc68/vc68_cl307_project4_progress_report.pdf](./Project4_cl307_vc68/vc68_cl307_project4_progress_report.pdf) and [Project4_cl307_vc68/vc68_cl307_project4_report.pdf](./Project4_cl307_vc68/vc68_cl307_project4_report.pdf) for detailed analysis and results.
