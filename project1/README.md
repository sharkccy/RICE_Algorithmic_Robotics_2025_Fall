# Project 1: Motion Planning Analysis with OMPL

## Introduction

- The objective of this project is to get familiar with OMPL (Open-source Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit.)

- Observe the performance of PRM, RRT, RTTConnect and KPIECE algorithms under different settings (e.g., different environments, parameter configurations, and planning problems) with OMPL benchmark library. 

- See [S01547146 Chung-Yu (Vincent Chang) Project 1.pdf](./S01547146%20Chung-Yu%20(Vincent%20Chang)%20Project%201.pdf) for detailed analysis and results.

- See [project1/README.md](./project1/README.md) to run the code.
