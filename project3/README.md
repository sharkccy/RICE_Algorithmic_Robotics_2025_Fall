# Project 3: Path Planning with Random Tree Planning (RTP)

Name: Chung-Yu (Vincent) Chang 張仲瑜, Chen-En (Sean) Lin 林辰恩 

## Introduction

- In this project, we aim to solve a path planning problem for point and square robots in two customized environments by implementing Random Tree Planning algorithm from scratch. 
- Furthermore, we compare performance of four planners including RTP, RRT, RRT-Connect and PRM with metrics such as planning time, path smoothness, path length and path clearance to find out which planner is more suitable for different
  scenarios.

- See [Project3_vc68_cl307_report](./Project3_vc68_cl307_report.pdf) for detailed analysis and results.
- See [project3_2025_part_b/project3_2025/README.md](./hw/project3/README.md) to see how to run the code.
