# Project 2: Motion Planning Analysis with OMPL

## Introduction

- In this project, we aim to finish three collision checking functions for point, round and square robots given robot’s x, y coordinate,
  orientation (for square one), side length (for square one) and rectangular obstacles’ coordinate. 

- Collision checking is essential for robot planning algorithms to verify whether certain points in the configuration space are valid in robot’s working space

- See [vc68_Chung_Yu_(Vincent)_Chang_Project 2](./vc68_Chung_Yu_(Vincent)_Chang_Project_2.pdf) for detailed analysis and results.

- See [Project2_vc68/README.md](./Project2_vc68/README.md) to see how to run the code.
