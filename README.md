# RICE Algorithmic Robotics 2025 Fall
  
Name: Chung-Yu (Vincent) Chang (張仲瑜)

## Introduction:

This repository contains the projects for the RICE Algorithmic Robotics course in 2025 Fall.
Most of the projects are implemented with OMPL (Open-source Mobile Robot Programming Toolkit).
We implemented motion planning algorithms including RTP, RGRRT from scratch, and used OMPL's built-in algorithms to solve various motion planning problems.

I was a master student of computer science when taking this course.
